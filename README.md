# Miragon AI Starter

Build your own MCP server on the published `@miragon-ai` modules — Camunda 7 /
CIB Seven BPM operations and Prometheus-backed process analytics, both with
interactive widgets — and add modules for your own systems.
`modules/mcp-notes` is a small example module that shows the whole pattern;
copying it is how you start yours.

Everything installs from the public npm registry — no credentials needed.

## Quickstart

Two ways to run it — from source while you develop, or as a container once you
deploy.

### 1. From source

Prerequisites: Node 22.22.2 or newer (`corepack enable` provides the pinned pnpm).

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env  # engine + Prometheus URLs; `pnpm dev` loads it
pnpm dev              # MCP endpoint on :8400/mcp, inspector on :8400/mcp/inspector
```

### 2. As a container

The image takes its config from the environment — it never reads `.env`.

```bash
pnpm install          # once, then commit pnpm-lock.yaml (the build uses --frozen-lockfile)
docker build -t my-mcp-server .
docker run -p 8400:8400 \
  -e CAMUNDA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8410/engine-rest \
  -e PROMETHEUS_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8460 \
  my-mcp-server
```

Either way the MCP endpoint is `http://localhost:8400/mcp`. With `pnpm dev`,
open the inspector at `http://localhost:8400/mcp/inspector` and call
`notes_show_notes` — the example widget renders with no external systems (the
production entrypoint the image runs mounts no inspector).
The camunda7/analytics tools need a running engine and Prometheus; the
[miragon-ai playground](https://github.com/Miragon/miragon-ai/tree/main/playground)
ships a ready-made Docker Compose stack whose URLs match `.env.example`.

## Connect an assistant

The server speaks streamable HTTP on `/mcp`. Tools work in every MCP host;
widgets render in hosts that support MCP Apps (the inspector is the local
render check).

**Claude Desktop** — its `claude_desktop_config.json` validates **stdio servers
only**, so a bare `"url"` entry is silently dropped. Bridge the HTTP endpoint
with [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote). Open Settings →
Developer → Edit Config
(macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`,
Windows `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`), then restart the app:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "mcp-remote", "http://127.0.0.1:8400/mcp", "--transport", "http-only"]
    }
  }
}
```

Use `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost` — Node may resolve the latter to IPv6
while the server listens on IPv4.

**Claude Code** — HTTP natively, no bridge:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http my-mcp-server http://localhost:8400/mcp
```

**claude.ai (custom connector)** — needs a deployed server reachable over the
public internet (Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector with your
`https://…/mcp` URL); localhost is not reachable from Anthropic's
infrastructure. To try a local build against a hosted assistant, tunnel it —
see the `setup-server` skill.

## Built for AI-assisted development

Open this repo in Claude Code (or any agent that reads `CLAUDE.md`) and
describe what you want — the skills in `.claude/skills/` walk the agent
through the four common tasks step by step:

| Skill                  | For…                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `setup-server`         | configuring, running, branding, and deploying          |
| `create-module`        | building a connector module for your own API or system |
| `add-widget`           | adding an interactive widget to a module               |
| `add-settings-section` | per-user settings for your module                      |

Everything works the same when done by hand: `CLAUDE.md` is the compact
architecture reference, and the guard tests in `server/test/` catch the
classic wiring mistakes — the ones whose failure mode would otherwise be
silent (a widget rendering empty, unstyled, or not at all).

## Make it yours

1. Rename the `@acme` scope in `server/package.json`,
   `modules/mcp-notes/package.json`, and the imports (the Dockerfile selects
   packages by path — no edit there); then re-run `pnpm install` to refresh
   `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
2. Swap the brand tokens (colors, radius, fonts) in
   `server/src/ui/globals.css`.

## Layout

| Path                 | Contents                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `server/`            | The composition root: module list (`src/setup.ts`), widget bundle (`src/ui/`), boot code |
| `server/test/`       | Guard tests — keep them; they cover your modules too                                     |
| `modules/mcp-notes/` | Example module: tools, an interactive widget, and its guard test                         |

## Adding your own module

```bash
cp -R modules/mcp-notes modules/mcp-<name>
```

Rename `notes` to your module name, put your API/SDK access behind the store
interface, and wire the module into the server: the `workspace:*` dependency
in `server/package.json`, the module list, the widget registry, and its
`definition` in the guard test. The `create-module` skill walks through every
step — and the guard tests fail loudly if a wiring step is missed.

## Configuration

[`.env.example`](.env.example) documents every variable this server reads;
copy it to `.env` (loaded by `pnpm dev` only — `pnpm start` and Docker take
their config from the environment). A variable under a watched prefix (`MCP_`,
`CAMUNDA_`, `PROMETHEUS_`, plus each module's own) that the server does not
read prints a warning at boot, so typos surface immediately.

| Variable                                     | Effect                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PORT`                                       | HTTP port (default 8400)                                         |
| `MCP_URL`                                    | Public base URL (behind a proxy/gateway)                         |
| `MCP_ACTIVE_MODULES`                         | Comma list, e.g. `camunda7:read-only,notes` (default: all)       |
| `MCP_PROFILE_DIR`                            | Filesystem persistence for user profiles (default: in-memory)    |
| `MCP_PROFILE_SESSION_TTL_DAYS`               | Expiry for session-keyed profile records (default 30, `0` = off) |
| `MCP_DASHBOARD_DIR`                          | Filesystem persistence for saved dashboards (default: in-memory) |
| `CAMUNDA_*`, `PROMETHEUS_URL`, `NOTES_TITLE` | Module config — see `.env.example` for the full list             |

## Deploying

The image built in the [Quickstart](#2-as-a-container) is the deployment
artifact. Two things to add beyond the local run:

```bash
docker run -p 8400:8400 \
  -e MCP_URL=https://mcp.example.com \
  -e MCP_PROFILE_DIR=/data/profiles -e MCP_DASHBOARD_DIR=/data/dashboards \
  -v mcp-data:/data \
  my-mcp-server
```

- `MCP_URL` is the public base URL when the server sits behind a proxy or MCP
  gateway; `PORT` changes the HTTP port.
- Both stores are in-memory by default — without the volume, user settings and
  saved dashboards are lost on every restart.
- `/health/live`, `/health/ready` and `/metrics` (Prometheus) are served next
  to `/mcp`, outside any OAuth gate — the image's `HEALTHCHECK` polls
  `/health/ready`; point Kubernetes probes and a ServiceMonitor at them.

## Going further

The stock server (`apps/mcp-server-camunda7` in the
[miragon-ai repo](https://github.com/Miragon/miragon-ai)) additionally ships,
and is the reference for: OAuth (Keycloak/Auth0/OIDC), Postgres profile and
dashboard stores for multi-instance deployments, and a Playwright host
simulation of the widget bundle.
